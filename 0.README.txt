Worksheets to set up a virtual LAN.  Also needed: Linux and VyOS install images (freely available), MS-Windows 7 install image and Microsoft LLTD-for-Linux software.
Another Linux VM can be used instead of Win7, with modification to some exercises and the LLTD exercise omitted.

Suggested order of usage:
1) VM-LAN.00.VirtualBox  ---  install and initial-configure two clients (1 Linux, 1 Win7)
2) VM-LAN.01.LLTD  ---  look at Microsoft's LLTD layer-2 protocol in action
3) VM-LAN.02.scapy  ---  try out hand-crafting of frames on the LAN
4) VM-LAN.03.private-LAN  ---  set static IP addresses
5) VM-LAN.04.VyOS-router  ---  add router as a 3rd VM
6) VM-LAN.05.DHCP  ---  configure DHCP on the LAN
7) VM-LAN.06.firewall  ---  configure a firewall (in preparation for rejoining the Internet)
8) VM-LAN.07.border-router  ---  configure a "border" router that connects (via VirtualBox) to the campus network and the Internet
9) VM-LAN.08.servers --- examine webserver and ftp server traffice on the local subnet
