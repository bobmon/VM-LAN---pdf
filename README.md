# VM-LAN---pdf

.pdfs of exercises to set up a virtual-machine-based LAN and configure it for operation as a subnet.  Installation requires VirtualBox (available online), Linux and VyOS installation images (readily available online), MS-Windows 7 installation image and Microsoft-provided LLTD-sampl-code for Linux.  The Microsoft items are not included.  Another Linux image can be used instead of the Win7 image, with modification of some exercises.
